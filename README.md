## Hi there! 👋
I'm Ethan, an incoming Data Science student at National University of Singapore. My interests range from data science and machine learning to psychology and finance. 

### ⭐ Currently, I am:
* Getting ready for university.

### 🚀 So far, my curiosity has led me to:
* Create and optimise a [Neural Network from Scratch](https://github.com/ethancqy/portfolio/tree/main/Neural%20Network%20from%20Scratch%20(MNIST)) using MNIST data.

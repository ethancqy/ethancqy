## Hi there! 👋
I'm Ethan, a Data Science student at National University of Singapore. I have many interests, but here are a few: data science, machine learning, finance, cognitive psychology, analytical philosophy. 

I enjoy analysis and strive to think critically about the world, this pushes me to embark on interesting projects and constantly try new things. Hope you find what I do interesting as well :)

### ⭐ Currently, I am:
* In university.

### 🚀 So far, my curiosity has led me to:
* Conduct **Spectral Working Memory Load Analysis** using EEG and iEEG signals. [[Link](https://github.com/ethancqy/portfolio/tree/main/Working%20Memory%20Load%20Analysis%20via%20EEG%20and%20iEEG%20Signals%20in%20Sternberg%20Task)]
* Create and optimise a **Neural Network from Scratch** using MNIST data. [[Link](https://github.com/ethancqy/portfolio/tree/main/Neural%20Network%20from%20Scratch%20(MNIST))]

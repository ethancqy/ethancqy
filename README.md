## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me:
I'm Ethan, an incoming Data Science student at National University of Singapore. <br>
My interests range from data science and machine learning to psychology and finance.

### Some Projects:
So far, my curiosity has led me to:
* Create and optimise a [Neural Network from Scratch](https://github.com/ethancqy/portfolio/tree/main/Neural%20Network%20from%20Scratch%20(MNIST)) using MNIST data.
